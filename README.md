## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

  * **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

  * **npm** (Node Package Manager): Usually comes bundled with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```

    *(Remember to replace `your-username/your-repository-name.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)*

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    Change your current directory to the newly cloned project folder:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Once inside the project directory, install all the necessary Node.js packages by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the required libraries and frameworks.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

```

This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use). The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
